# Chapter 3
## 3.1 - Introduction
- **Syntax** is the form of its expressions, statements, and program units
- **Semantics** the meaning of those expressions, statements, and program units
- Example the syntax of a Java `while` statement is:
<br>
    ```java
    while (boolean_expression) statement
    ```
<br>
- Semtantics is when value of boolean_expression is `true`, statement is executed. Control implicitly returns to the Boolean expression
to repeat the process. If control of Boolean expression is false, control transfers to statement following `while` construct.
