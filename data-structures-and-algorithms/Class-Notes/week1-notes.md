# Week 1 notes
### Coding standards
- Docstring and comments are crucial
- Max line length: 79 characters
- Add python type hints
- always use virtual envs
- Never upload with the virtual env files
- use the 'time' package to time algorithms
### Algorithm Review
- Input's size
    - size of the input value (number of input items; the bit size of the input value)
- Basic operation
    - operation that contributes the most to the running time of the algorithm
- `T(n) = C<sub>op</sub> * C(n)`
- T(n) -> running time of an algorithm
- C<sub>op</sub> -> execution time for teh basic operation
- C(n) -> number of times the basic operation is executed
