## Background
- Chromosospheric filaments are dense "clouds" of solar material
    - formed by (PIL) Polarity Inversion Lines which separates positive and negative polarities of magnetix flux of Sun.
- Chirality of a filament refers to orientation of magnetic field lines that make up a filament
- filaments appear in  solar corona that is viisble in absorption of H-alpha line on disk
- filaments are closely associated with solar eruptive events (Coronal Mass Ejection, CME), solar flares, and Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) storms
- An Earth-directed CME can cause enormous damage to our power supply grid, offset GPS system and can be lethal for astronauts as they travel outside protective bubble
    - proctive bubble provided by Earth's magnetosphere
- Large CMEs and high intensity solar flares are almost always associated with eruption of chromospheric filaments
