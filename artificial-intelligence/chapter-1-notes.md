## Acting humanly: Turing test approach
- Alan Turing's thought experiment for "Can a machine think?"
- A computer passes the test if a human interrogator can't tell if written responses come from a person or a computer
- Computer would need following capabilities
    1. Natural language processing: communicate successfully in a human language
    2. knowledge representation: store what it knows or hears
    3. automated reasoning: answer questions and to draw new conclusions
    4. machine learning: adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
- Total turing test which requires interaction with objects and people in real world
    - computer vision and speech recognition to preceive the world
    - robotics to manipulate objects and move about
- researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing test
- Aeronautical engineering doesn't make "machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons"
## Thinking humanly: coginitive modeling approach
- to say program thinks like human, must know how humans think
    1. introspection: trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
    2. psychological experiments - observing a person in action
    3. brain imaging - observing the brain in action
- cognitive science with AI models techniques from psychology construct precise and testable theories of the human mind
## Thinking rationally: the laws of thought
- Aristotle codified "right thinking"
- syllogisms provided patterns for argument structures that always yeiled correct conclusions when given correct premises
    - Socratees is man
    - all men are mortal
    - therefore, socrates is mortal
- initiated the field called **logic**
- based on correct inferences
## Acting rationally: the rational agent
- rational agent
    - acts to achieve the best outcome. When uncertain, best expected outcome
- Rational agent approach to AI has prevailed throughout most of the fields history
- advtanges rational agent has over others
    - more general than the laws of thought because correct inferences is just one of the several mechanisms for achieving rationality
    - standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and more general
- AI has focused on the study and constructions of agents that **do the right thing**
- what counts as the right thing is defined by the objective we pass to the agent
- This paradigm could be called the **standard model**
