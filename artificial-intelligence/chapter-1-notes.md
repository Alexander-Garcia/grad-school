- Acting humanly: Turing test approach
    - Alan Turing's thought experiment for "Can a machine think?"
    - A computer passes the test if a human interrogator can't tell if written responses come from a person or a computer
    - Computer would need following capabilities
        1. Natural language processing: communicate successfully in a human language
        2. knowledge representation: store what it knows or hears
        3. automated reasoning: answer questions and to draw new conclusions
        4. machine learning: adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
    - Total turing test which requires interaction with objects and people in real world
        - computer vision and speech recognition to preceive the world
        - robotics to manipulate objects and move about
    - researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing test
    - Aeronautical engineering doesn't make "machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons"
- Thinking humanly: coginitive modeling approach
    - to say program thinks like human, must know how humans think
        1. introspection: trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
        2. psychological experiments - observing a person in action
        3. brain imaging - observing the brain in action
